# bioinformatics_tools
Here we attempt to develop working, unoptimized code that might help in our jobs as bioinformaticians

Feel free to write your ideas below

Wtf are we doing:
General
Flags on execution
File format identification
Multithreading
 
DNA/RNA
-Prokaryotic/Eukaryotic
-ORF Identification
-GC Content
-Splicing
-Alignment (2 seqs)
-Multiple alignment
-Transcription
-rimer design
-Translation
-Long-read sequence assembly (Building genome from shotgun sequencing data)
 
Proteins
-Protein charge
-Structure clustering (PCA, k-means)
-Sequence clustering
-Secondary structure prediction (DSSP) (based on hydrogen bonds etc.)
-Surface area (Exposed aminoacids etc.)
-Folding (One can only dream)
-Docking (lol)
-dPCA calculation
            	
            	
 
Why are we doing this?
We simply were bored.
 
 
What programming language are we using and why?


What is the name of the program and why?
